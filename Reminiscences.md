## REMINISCENCES OF A STOCK OPERATOR
### Chapter I
I went to work when I was just out of grammar school . I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stockbrokerage office. I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one. I was particularly good at mental arithmetic. As quotation-board boy I posted the numbers on the big board in the customers' room. One of the customers usually sat by the ticker and called out the prices. They couldn't come too fast for me. I have always remembered figures. No trouble at all. 
我小学刚毕业就工作了，在一家股票经纪公司找了一份工作，职位是报价板男孩。我对数字很敏感。在学校时，我一年就学完了三年的算术课程。我特别擅长心算。作为报价板男孩，我负责在客户大厅的大黑板上更新数字。通常有一位客户坐在股票行情机旁边，喊出最新的价格。无论价格更新得多快，我都能跟得上。我一直对数字记忆力很好，完全不费劲。

注解：
- grammar school - 这里说明了利弗莫尔的学历，也为后面利弗莫尔靠什么读盘埋下了伏笔。一个小学毕业的人能会什么数学方法呢？估计就是均线吧。
- quick at figures - 股票市场每天都会产生大量数据：价格、成交量、涨跌幅、财报数据等。一个“quick at figures”的人能迅速理解这些数字背后的含义，从而做出更快、更准确的判断。
- particularly good at mental arithmetic - 擅长心算也就是有很好的记忆力，优秀的记忆力能帮你记住过去发生的事，以便这件事在未来再次发生时，你能从容应对。

There were plenty of other employees in that office. Of course I made friends with the other fellows, but the work I did, if the market was active, kept me too busy from ten a.m. to three p.m. to let me do much talking. I don't care for it, anyhow, during business hours. 那家公司里还有很多其他员工。当然，我和其他同事也成了朋友，但如果市场活跃，我从上午十点忙到下午三点，工作太多，根本没时间多说话。再说了，我本来也不喜欢在工作时间聊天。

But a busy market did not keep me from thinking about the work. Those quotations did not represent prices of stocks to me, so many dollars per share. They were numbers. Of course, they meant something. They were always changing. It was all I had to be interested in the changes. Why did they change? I didn't know. I didn't care. I didn't think about that. I simply saw that they changed. That was all I had to think about five hours every day and two on Saturdays: that they were always changing. 但市场的繁忙并未使我停止对这项工作的思考。那些行情报价对我而言，并不只是每股若干美元的股票价格，它们是数字。当然，它们有其意义，而且总在变动。而我所关心的，正是这些变化。它们为何变动？我不知道，也不在意，更未深思。我只是看到它们在变动。每天五小时，星期六两小时，我所要思考的，仅仅是：它们始终在变。

注解：
- Those quotations did not represent prices of stocks to me - 从数学方面解读盘面。
- always changing - 投机活动存在的重要前提。
- Why did they change? I didn't know. I didn't care. I didn't think about that. - 从原因得到结果很简单，但从结果反推原因却难如登天。有时候盘面已经提前反应出原因了，但当你知道原因后再操作就为时已晚了。

That is how I first came to be interested in the behaviour of prices. I had a very good memory for figures. I could remember in detail how the prices had acted on the previous day, just before they went up or down. My fondness for mental arithmetic came in very handy. 这就是我最初对价格行为产生兴趣的原因。我对数字的记忆力非常好。我能详细记住前一天价格的走势，尤其是在它们上涨或下跌之前。我对心算的喜爱也派上了大用场。

注解：
- remember in detail - 再一次强调了记忆力的重要性。

I noticed that in advances as well as declines, stock prices were apt to show certain habits, so to speak. There was no end of parallel cases and these made precedents to guide me. I was only fourteen, but after I had taken hundreds of observations in my mind I found myself testing their accuracy, comparing the behaviour of stocks to-day with other days. It was not long before I was anticipating movements in prices. My only guide, as I say, was their past performances. I carried the "dope sheets" in my mind. I looked for stock prices to run on form. I had "clocked" them. You know what I mean. 我注意到，在股价上涨和下跌的过程中，股票价格往往会表现出某些“习惯”，可以这么说。有无数类似的情况，这些都成了我用来指导自己的先例。那时我才十四岁，但在脑海中进行了数百次观察之后，我开始检验它们的准确性，把今天股票的表现与其他日子进行比较。没过多久，我就开始预测价格的变动了。正如我所说，我唯一的依据就是它们过去的表现。我把那些“情报表”都记在脑子里。我期待股票价格会按规律运行。我已经“计时”过它们了。你明白我的意思吧。

注解：
- There was no end of parallel cases - 当某种情况反复出现，我们就可以总结其规律，就像人们总结出的太阳东升西落的规律一样。所以我们要大量的读盘才可以总结其规律。当然这里记忆力相当重要，如果脑海中无法记住大量的行情数据，大脑是无法总结出经验的。
